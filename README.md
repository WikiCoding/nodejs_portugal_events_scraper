# Summary

Little application that grabs events from my district, Porto in Portugal. Those events are comming from 2 popular web sources, which in my opinion, could have simplified display as a list without much detail and images.
In general the backend server is fetching the data from the sources, treating the data and providing a cleaned json payload to the frontend so I can show the events without ads and as a simple list with links that will direct you to details about each event.

This application is publicly available, so anyone can use it, at:
https://portugal-events.onrender.com/

(I'm using a free account to the website spins off after 1 minute or so of inactivity, so it it's shut down will also take a minute or so to come up)
